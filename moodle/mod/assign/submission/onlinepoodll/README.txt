Online PoodLL Submission for Moodle 2.3 Assignments
========================================
Thanks for downloading Online PoodLL submission type. 
Using this you can accept video and audio recordings, pictures and snapshots as assignment submissions.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

If you are installing this mod separately from the full PoodLL kaboodle,
there should be only one folder "onlinepoodll" expanded after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/mod/assign/submission folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page(under site administration). 
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the Online PoodLL submission type for the Moodle 2.3+ assignment. 

When you go to create an assignment you should see an option to enable Online PoodLL submissions in the settings page. 
Beneath that you will see a choice of PoodLL recorders to use in the submission.
1) Video recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
2) Audio Recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
3) MP3 Recording (doesn't require Red5)
4) Whiteboard (draw pictures)
5) Snapshot (take photos with webcam)

Moodle caching can affect audio/video playback reliability. To turn off text filter caching:  
Go to: Site Administration -> Plugins -> Filters ->Common Filter Settings
There set "Text Cache Lifetime" to "no"

*Please be aware that the Online PoodLL submission type relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Good luck.
